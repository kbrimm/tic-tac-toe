Most definitely not a coding exercise for a job interview.

## Gameplay Basics

A player gets a designated token - 'x' or 'o' - which they can place on the board in any one of the nine spots, so long as it is otherwise unoccupied. Play then passes to the next player, who places their own, opposing token. Each player's objective is to place three of these tokens in a straight line, which can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal in orientation.

### Rules

1. Play begins with a blank 3x3 board.
2. Play alternates between two players.
3. Players may only place their designated token in a valid, unoccupied square on the board.
4. A placed token cannot be moved.
5. Play ends when a player has won the game, all squares are occupied, or all possible routes to success are blocked.
